In this project sketch we define the group of inner automorphisms of a group and show that the group `GL (Fin n) ℝ` has an automorphism that is not inner.

/-
A group homomorphism is a `MonoidHom` and is denoted by `→+` and a group isomorphism
is a `MulEquiv` and is denoted by `≃*`.

A `MulEquiv` is defined as a `structure`. To see the fields of `MulEquiv`, you can use `#print`:
-/

#print MulEquiv

/-
Note that in this case, `MulEquiv` has two fields: `toEquiv` and `map_mul'`. Since `toEquiv` is an
`Equiv`, it is again a structure, whose fields you can check with
-/

#print Equiv

/-
Note that this also unfolds the `toEquiv` field.

To define a term of a type defined by `structure`, use the `def foo : bar where` syntax.

/-
Every element `g : G` defines an automorphism of `G` by conjugation.
-/

def conjugate (g : G) : G ≃* G where
  toFun x := g * x * g⁻¹
  invFun x := g⁻¹ * x * g
  left_inv x := by group
  right_inv x := by group
  map_mul' x y := by group

`conjugate` as a group homomorphism.

As an example we show that the kernel of the conjugation is the center of the group.

/-
The group of inner automorphisms of `G` is the subgroup of automorphisms, which are given by
conjugation with an element of `G`.
-/

def InnerAut : Subgroup (G ≃* G) where
  carrier := { σ : G ≃* G | ∃ (g : G), conjugate g = σ }

If `φ` is an inner automorphism of `GL (Fin n) ℝ` and `A : GL (Fin n) ℝ`, the characteristic
polynomials of `A` and `φ A` agree.

    Matrix.charpoly A.val = Matrix.charpoly (φ.val A).val :=

/-
The transpose of an element of `GL (Fin n) ℝ`.

*Hint:* Alternatively you can use `Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.mkOfDetNeZero`.
-/

def Matrix.GeneralLinearGroup.transpose (A : GL (Fin n) ℝ) : GL (Fin n) ℝ where
  val := A.val.transpose
  inv := A.inv.transpose
  val_inv := sorry
  inv_val := sorry

/-
The automorphism of `GL (Fin n) ℝ` sending `A` to the transpose of `A⁻¹`.
-/

def transposeInv : GL (Fin n) ℝ ≃* GL (Fin n) ℝ where
  toFun g := g⁻¹.transpose
  invFun g := g⁻¹.transpose
  left_inv := sorry
  right_inv := sorry
  map_mul' := sorry

/-
State and prove that `transposeInv` is not an inner-automorphism of `GL (Fin n) ℝ`.

*Hint:* For the proof use `charpoly_eq_of_inner`.
