# Euclidean rings

By Judith Ludwig, Christian Merten and Florent Schaffhauser,
Proseminar on computer-assisted mathematics,
Heidelberg, Summer Semester 2024

In this project sketch, we introduce principal ideal domains and Euclidean rings. We explore some examples and show that every Euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain.

A possible further goal could be stating (and possibly proving) the existence of the Smith Normalform.

/-
We can find lemma names by using the library search tactic `exact?`.
-/

example (a b : ℤ) : a % b + b * (a / b) = a := by
  --exact?
  exact Int.emod_add_ediv a b

/-
A commutative ring is a *principal ideal domain* (PID) if it is a domain and every ideal is principal.
-/

structure IsPID (R : Type) [CommRing R] : Prop where
  isDomain : IsDomain R
  ideal_principal : ∀ (I : Ideal R), ∃ (x : R), Ideal.span {x} = I

/-
Note: We used the `structure` command to define `IsPID`. If you encounter a structure, you can inspect its fields with the `#print` command:
-/

#print IsPID

/-
To construct a term of a type defined by `structure`, use the `def foo : bar where` (or `theorem foo : bar where`) syntax.

For more information about structures, see https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/structures_and_records.html

Next we prove that a field is a principal ideal domain.
-/







/- `IsDomain` is a so-called 'typeclass'. We don't get into the details here, but this means that we can use `inferInstance` to ask Lean to automatically fill in a proof.
  In this case `IsDomain` is already proven for any field. -/

A *Euclidean function* on a commutative ring is a height function `R → ℕ` and a division with remainder, where the height of the remainder is smaller than the denominator.

Note: This is not merely a proposition, but contains the data of a height function. This height function is not unique, so the datum of a ring `R` with a term `h : Euclidean R` is not equivalent to the notion of a Euclidean domain (see `IsEuclideanDomain`).

An integral domain is called a Euclidean domain if it admits a Euclidean function.

/-
A Euclidean structure on a field `k`.

Note 1: Observe that we can change the `42` in the proof below to an arbitrary value. In particular, the height function is not unique!
Note 2: This is a `def` and not a `theorem`, because it contains data. Try to see what happens if you replace `def` by `theorem`!
